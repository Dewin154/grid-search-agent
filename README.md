# Grid Agent Pathfinding
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Dewin154/grid-search-agent?label=Version&color=green)

A Python simulation where an intelligent agent finds the shortest path from start to goal through a randomly generated grid using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. This tool serves demonstration/teaching/learning purposes.

## Download
You don't need Python installed to try this out!

👉 **[Download the latest executable here](https://github.com/Dewin154/grid-search-agent/releases/latest)**

Simply download the `.exe` and run.

## Planned features
- Implement more search algorithms (DFS, UCS, Best-First-Search etc.)
- Implement animations to visualize search process
- Implement more customization for user (e.g.: Random generated/Self-placed walls, adjust wall ratio etc.)
- Implement Reinforcement Learning solution
- Implement interactive grid for user to customize it (in far future)
